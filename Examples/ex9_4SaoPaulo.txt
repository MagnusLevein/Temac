São Paulo is a cosmopolitan, melting pot city, home to the largest Arab, Italian,
Japanese, and Portuguese diasporas, with examples including ethnic neighborhoods
of Bixiga, Bom Retiro, and Liberdade. São Paulo is also home to the largest Jewish
population in Brazil, with about 75,000 Jews. In 2016, inhabitants of the city were
native to over 200 different countries.

People from the city are known as paulistanos, while paulistas designates anyone
from the state, including the paulistanos. The city's Latin motto, which it has
shared with the battleship and the aircraft carrier named after it, is Non ducor,
duco, which translates as "I am not led, I lead."

The city, which is also colloquially known as Sampa or Terra da Garoa (Land of 
Drizzle), is known for its unreliable weather, the size of its helicopter fleet,
its architecture, gastronomy, severe traffic congestion and skyscrapers. São Paulo
was one of the host cities of the 1950 and the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Additionally,
