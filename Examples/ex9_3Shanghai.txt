Originally a fishing village and market town, Shanghai grew in importance
in the 19th century due to both domestic and foreign trade and its favorable
port location. The city was one of five treaty ports forced to open to
European trade after the First Opium War. The Shanghai International
Settlement and the French Concession were subsequently established. The
city then flourished, becoming a primary commercial and financial hub of
Asia in the 1930s.
