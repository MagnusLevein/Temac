	Mexico City is the capital and largest city of Mexico, and is both
	the oldest capital city in the Americas and one of two founded by
	indigenous people. The city was originally built on a group of islands
	in Lake Texcoco by the Mexica (Azteca) in 1325 as Tenochtitlan. It
	was almost completely destroyed in the 1521 Siege of Tenochtitlan 
	and subsequently redesigned and rebuilt in accordance with the Spanish
	urban standards. In 1524, the municipality of Mexico City was 
	established, known as México Tenochtitlán, and as of 1585, it was 
	officially known as Ciudad de México (Mexico City). Mexico City was
	the political, administrative, and financial center of a major part of
	the Spanish colonial empire. After independence from Spain was achieved,
	the federal district was created in 1824.
