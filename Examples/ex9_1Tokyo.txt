Originally a fishing village, named Edo, the city became a prominent political
center in 1603, when it became the seat of the Tokugawa shogunate. By the mid-18th
century, Edo was one of the most populous cities in the world at over one million.

Following the end of the shogunate in 1868, the imperial capital in Kyoto was moved
to the city, which was renamed Tokyo (literally "eastern capital").
